# APFPV Firmware - Complete Beginner's Guide

APFPV stands for "Access Point FPV" - it's a simple way to get video from your drone to your phone, tablet, or computer using regular WiFi. Think of it like your drone creating its own WiFi hotspot that you connect to for live video.

## What is APFPV?

The APFPV firmware from the OpenIPC team creates direct WiFi communication between your drone's video transmitter (VTX) and your ground station. Instead of complex mesh networks, your drone simply acts like a WiFi router that you connect to directly.

This isn't meant to be revolutionary technology - it's designed to be **simple and accessible**, especially for people who find other FPV systems too complicated to set up.

## Why Choose APFPV?

**Perfect for beginners because:**
- No complicated setup or configuration needed
- Works with any phone, tablet, or computer with WiFi
- No special equipment required for your ground station
- Simple web interface you can open in any browser
- Your ground station can be **absolutely anything** with WiFi!

**Great for:**
- Learning FPV without technical complexity
- Slow-moving vehicles (cars, boats, gentle flying)
- Non-aerobatic flying (planes and quadcopters)
- Using any device as your FPV screen
- Experimenting with different ground station equipment

**Important limitations:**
- Has 40-70ms delay (not suitable for fast aerobatics or racing). 35ms is possible with the right equipment
- Delay depends on many factors including distance and interference

## What You'll Need

### For Your Drone (VTX):
- OpenIPC-compatible camera/board
- WiFi chip (RTL8812AU or RTL8733BU supported - most common ones work)

### For Viewing (Ground Station):
- **Android**: PixelPilot app (recommended)
- **Computer**: Any computer with WiFi and a web browser
- **Professional**: Outdoor WiFi equipment (TP-Link, Ubiquiti, etc.)
- **Any device**: That can receive RTP video streams

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Installing APFPV Firmware

There are two ways to install APFPV firmware on your drone. The internet method is much easier if your drone can connect to WiFi.

1. On your computer, go to: https://github.com/OpenIPC/builder/releases/download/latest/openipc.ssc338q-nor-apfpv.tgz
2. Download the file
3. Extract/unzip it - you'll get two files:
   - `uImage.ssc338q`
   - `rootfs.squashfs.ssc338q`

### Step 2: Copy Files to Drone

**Using WinSCP (Windows):**
1. Download and install WinSCP
2. Open WinSCP
3. Protocol: SCP
4. Host name: Your drone's IP address
5. Username and password: Your drone's login credentials
6. Click "Login"
7. Navigate to `/tmp` folder on drone side
8. Copy both firmware files to `/tmp`

**Using SCP command (Mac/Linux):**
```bash
scp uImage.ssc338q root@[drone-ip]:/tmp/
scp rootfs.squashfs.ssc338q root@[drone-ip]:/tmp/
```

### Step 3: Install Firmware

1. SSH into your drone (see "How to SSH" above)
2. Type this command:
```bash
sysupgrade -z -n --kernel=/tmp/uImage.ssc338q --rootfs=/tmp/rootfs.squashfs.ssc338q
```
3. Press Enter
4. Wait for installation to complete (5-10 minutes)
5. Drone will reboot automatically
