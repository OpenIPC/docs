### Basic setup summary
The VRX is configured with the default gs.key and should work with either RunCam or EMAX VTXs. After basic setup you will get cheapest modern digital FPV system. The manufacturer currently doesn't have any manuals for the Wyvern Link v2 hardware.



## Advanced setup

It is recommended to flash the latest firmware onto an SDcard and boot from the SDcard to get the latest features. Once a new stable firmware is available for flashing onto the internal eMMC, we will update the documentation.


### Flash SBC 2.0.0 Beta2 
Download [SBC 2.0.0 Beta](https://github.com/OpenIPC/sbc-groundstations/releases/tag/zero3w-v2.0.0-beta2) and flash onto an SDcard using belenaEtcher.


### How to get gs.key?

 -   Insert an empty, formatted micro SD into the VTX. The card
    > pads need to face the board. The slot for the micro SD can be on
    > the 'inside' of the board so you might need to disassemble it to
    > put the card in.

 -   When you first power up your VTX, the device will create a 'user'
    > file and a 'gs.key' file. Take the SD card out from your VTX
    > and copy the GS.key file into your VRX(android device, PC, etc.).
