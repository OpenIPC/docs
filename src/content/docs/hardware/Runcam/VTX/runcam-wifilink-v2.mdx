## Basic setup
For advanced setup guide please read this [article](/use-cases/fpv/advanced-setup/).
### What you need
 -   Flight controller with betaflight, INAV, Ardupilot.
 -   Runcam WiFiLink 2 + [Pixelpilot](https://github.com/OpenIPC/PixelPilot)
 -   RTL8812AU wifi adapter (Comes in package if you bought WiFiLink2-G)
 -   USB C OTG adapter (Comes in package if you bought WiFiLink2-G)
 -   A fairly modern Smartphone with Android 13 or 14 installed. The smartphone should have a good processor or you`ll get big latency
 -   Internet connection


### Hardware Setup

 -   Connect the antennas to VTX.

 -   Connect the 4 cable to UART on FC dedicated to connecting
     digital VTX's(as on image below) or direct solder to UART on FC(you should connect power input to BEC output on FC). \
     **Attention:** the cable color codes will match only on one end.
     Double check your wiring (gnd to gnd, vcc to vcc, etc)
     ![image](/images/runcam-wifilink-v2-to-fc-connection.png)

 -   Insert a formatted micro SD card into the VTX. The slot is on the
    bottom of the unit, when the fan faces up.

 -   Connect an Ethernet cable supplied with your VTX to the device.


### How to get gs.key?

 -   Insert an empty, formatted micro SD into the VTX. The card
    > pads need to face the board. The slot for the micro SD can be on
    > the 'inside' of the board so you might need to disassemble it to
    > put the card in.

 -   When you first power up your VTX, the device will create a 'user'
    > file and a 'gs.key' file. Take the SD card out from your VTX
    > and copy the GS.key file into your VRX(android device, PC, etc.).

### How to connect to android GS
 - Install [Pixelpilot](https://github.com/OpenIPC/PixelPilot).
 - Copy gs.key to your android device.
 - Connect RTL8812AU based WiFi adapter to your android device.
 - Open Pixelpilot using popup.
 - Press the gear icon. Set up: Channel - 161; Bandwidth - 20.
 - Add gs.key. Press the gear icon > press WFB-NG > press gs.key > select gs.key that you copied on stage 2.
 - Power on your VTX. \
 If you don`t see image after 30 seconds, restart Pixelpilot. If even this does not help use this check list.
    - Check lens cover.
    - Check gs.key.
    - Power cycle your android device and VTX.

### LEDs function
| LEDs status                       | Indicates               |
|:---------------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Green off                         | Audio off               |
| Green on                          | Audio on                |
| Green fast flashing               | Firmware upgrade        |
| Green slow flashing               | Recording on            |
| Blue on                           | Startup                 |
| Blue fast flashing                | WiFi error              |
| Blue and green alternating flash  | Overheat warning (>90℃) |

### Basic setup summary
After basic setup you will get cheapest modern digital FPV system, but you`ll not see OSD, to setup OSD you need to read [advanced setup article](/use-cases/fpv/advanced-setup/). If you want to read instruction from manufacturer, please read [this](https://store-m8o52p.mybigcommerce.com/product_images/img_runcam_wifilink2/wifilink2_manual-en.pdf).


### How to diagnose a failed flash  
This info was gathered from the RunCam Support on 06/2025:


To determine if Uboot is still accessible, the current of the Wifilink2 should be measured and compared to given values:
This can be achieved by a regulated power supply and/or a multimeter.
Power should be applied via the 6pin FC connector

| Case  | Voltage | Amps | Power  | Status|
|:------|---------|------|--------|--------|
|1|13.5 V| 0.182 A| 2.5 W| Uboot still accessible. This suggests the firmware flash failed, but U-Boot is still present. Firmware flash error, can be fixed with UART flashing.|
|2|13.5 V| &lt;=0.144 A| &lt;= 1.9 W| Uboot missing/unavailable. Need full reflash using chip programmer.|
