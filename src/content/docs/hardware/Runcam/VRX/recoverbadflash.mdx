If a bad flash has occured and the VRX memory (emmc) has been completely deleted, you will find that the VRX will not even boot up into command line. The Radxa has been completely wiped.
But you don't need to worry. This guide will help you easily recover or unbrick your VRX.

1. Make sure you have the correct firmware image for your install. Be that Ruby or the SBC image. It should be the standard image. NOT the emmc_flasher image.

2. You will need RKDevtool and the driver. You can get them here: https://chipsee.com/docs/PCs/ARM/RK3568/Manuals/Software/Buildroot_Linux_Qt_5_15.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqwVNDxG6CyfUQU13LUY4l1JzBCPZu-VdtFjQS_MgFvvfeG2lgK

3. Install the driver first.

11. Put your VRX in bootloader mode. On the bottom there is a small button you can press with a pin next to the HDMI port. Hold it in, power up the VRX, wait 2 seconds and release. The VRX should be in bootloader mode and you can connect it to PC via the Type C port. It should say this:
