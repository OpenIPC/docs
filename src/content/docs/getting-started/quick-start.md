Want to try out OpenIPC? If your camera is supported, you may be able to flash it with its stock firmware update process using an image from [Coupler.](https://github.com/openipc/coupler/)

Otherwise, check the [recommended hardware list](https://openipc.org/supported-hardware/featured) for your camera's SoC to generate an example installation guide using a serial connection and U-Boot.
