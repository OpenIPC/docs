RTL8731BU and RTL8733BU are very small WiFi chips, so RTL873xBU-based net cards are really small, because of that they are extremely popular for tinywhoops. But RTL873xBU-based net cards **AREN'T SUITABLE FOR LONG RANGE AND RX USE**. 5MHz, 10MHz, 20MHz, 40MHz modes are supported.
:::caution
40MHz mode supported by driver, **your** net card might not support this mode. Please contact seller before buying net card. Please add your net card to list of RTL873xBU-based NICs below.

:::caution
If you don't receive image after switching on 40MHz mode, please read this [article](/use-cases/fpv/unbrick-eu-bu/) to fix your issue.
