AU based NICs have exceptional community support so that 5Mhz, 10MHz, 20MHz and 40MHz can receive and transmit! So AU based equipment can achieve exceptional bitrates, as for example on 21-04-2025 52Mbps was achieved in total (36Mbps video).  On this page you can find information about known WiFi adapters with this chip.
