##  How Adaptive-Link Works  

Wireless communication can transmit data at high speeds over short distances with a strong signal, or slowly but over longer distances with a weaker signal.  

OpenIPC allows you to choose one fixed link speed and video bitrate. Default:  
- **Bitrate:** 4 Mbps  
- **Channel Width:** 20 MHz  
- **MCS:** 1  
- **FEC:** 8/12  
- **Guard Interval:** long  

This is a "universal" profile — moderate quality and average range.

**Adaptive-Link** solves this by automatically selecting the best link and video profile based on signal quality (RSSI and SNR).  

Strong signal = high speed and quality  
Weak signal = long-range profile and lower bitrate  

---

##  How It Works  

- **On the Ground Station**, `alink_gs` monitors RSSI and SNR, calculates a final "score" (1000–2000), and sends it to the drone.  
- **On the drone**, `alink_drone` receives the score and selects the appropriate profile from `/etc/txprofiles.conf`.  
- Profile transitions are controlled via `/etc/alink.conf`.

### Example:  
```ini
rssi_min = -80  
rssi_max = -40  
snr_min = 12  
snr_max = 36  
```

If RSSI = -60 and SNR = 20:  
- RSSI score = 1500  
- SNR score = 1333  
- Final score (with 0.5/0.5 weights) ≈ 1416  
- `alink` selects profile: `1051 - 1500`

## Installation

:::tip 
**An internet connection is required.**
:::

### On Drone (OpenIPC)
```bash
cd /etc
curl -L -o alink_install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenIPC/adaptive-link/refs/heads/main/alink_install.sh
chmod +x alink_install.sh
./alink_install.sh drone install
reboot
```

Add to autostart:
```bash
/etc/rc.local >>  alink_drone & 
```

### On Ground Station (Radxa / Android / PC)
```bash
sudo curl -L -o alink_install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenIPC/adaptive-link/refs/heads/main/alink_install.sh
sudo chmod +x alink_install.sh
sudo ./alink_install.sh gs install
```

**Config will be located at:**
- `/config/alink_gs.conf`, or
- `/home/radxa/alink_gs.conf`, or
- `/etc/alink_gs.conf`

## Configuration Files

### Profile Configuration: `/etc/txprofiles.conf`

Example configuration:
```bash
999 - 999 long 0 8 12 1999 10 30 0,0,0,0 20 -12
1000 - 1050 long 0 8 12 2000 10 30 0,0,0,0 20 -12
1051 - 1500 long 1 8 12 4000 10 25 0,0,0,0 20 -12
1501 - 1950 long 2 8 12 8000 10 20 12,6,6,12 20 -12
1951 - 2001 short 2 8 12 9000 10 20 12,6,6,12 20 -12
```

:::tip
Safe TX profiles can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenIPC/adaptive-link/tree/main/txprofiles)
:::

:::caution
Set the transmission power levels in `/etc/txprofiles.conf` carefully. The default is `30`, which is safe for most adapters but may be too low for some. Adjust the power accordingly to ensure optimal performance.

## Parameter TX profile

| Parameter        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Range**        | Score range where this profile applies                                      |
| **GI (Guard Interval)** | `short`: higher speed, less protection  `long`: more reliable at long range |
| **MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme)** | Lower value = lower speed, better stability  Higher value = higher throughput, requires stronger signal |
| **FEC (Forward Error Correction)** | Example: `8/12` means 8 bits data, 4 bits for error correction  Lower ratio = faster speed, less error protection |
| **Bitrate**      | Video stream speed in bits per second  Higher value = better quality, more bandwidth usage |
| **GOP (Group of Pictures)** | Determines how often keyframes appear  Lower value = more I-frames, better recovery from packet loss |
| **Pwr (Transmit Power)** | Transmission power of the radio signal  Higher power = longer range, more interference |
| **roiQP (Region of Interest QP)** | Prioritizes video quality in important parts of the frame  Lower value = better quality in the ROI area |
| **Bandwidth**    | Width of the radio channel in MHz  Wider = higher speed, narrower = better range |
| **qpDelta**      | Global video compression tuning  Lower value = higher quality, less compression |

### Behavior Configuration: `/etc/alink.conf`

Example configuration:
```ini
rssi_weight=0.3
snr_weight=0.7
fallback_ms=1000
hold_fallback_mode_s=3
min_between_changes_ms=150
hold_modes_down_s=4
hysteresis_percent=15
```


| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **rssi_weight** | Weight given to RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) in link quality calculations. Value of 0.3 means RSSI contributes 30% to the overall link quality assessment. |
| **snr_weight** | Weight given to SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) in link quality calculations. Value of 0.7 means SNR contributes 70% to the overall link quality assessment. |
| **fallback_ms** | Time in milliseconds (1000ms = 1 second) the system waits before activating fallback mode when signal deteriorates. |
| **hold_fallback_mode_s** | Duration in seconds (3s) the system remains in fallback mode even if signal improves, ensuring stability before switching back. |
| **min_between_changes_ms** | Minimum time in milliseconds (150ms) between transmission mode changes, preventing rapid fluctuations. |
| **hold_modes_down_s** | Time in seconds (4s) the system maintains lower transmission modes before attempting to increase quality/speed again. |
| **hysteresis_percent** | Percentage buffer (15%) required for a mode change, preventing minor signal fluctuations from causing unnecessary mode switches. |



## Troubleshooting

### If the drone stays in long-range mode (profile 999):
- Check ground station transmitter power
- Verify antenna connections
- Review `/etc/txprofiles.conf` settings

### If video quality is poor despite strong signal:
- Check bitrate settings in `/etc/txprofiles.conf`
- Ensure RSSI and SNR weights in `/etc/alink.conf` are set correctly

### If the system frequently changes settings:
- Increase `min_between_changes_ms` value in `/etc/alink.conf`
- Increase `hysteresis_percent` value in `/etc/alink.conf`

## Recommendations

- Don't choose profiles with high bitrate if your system can't handle the traffic
- Always tailor `txprofiles.conf` to your adapter — especially **power levels**
- Consider your specific use case when configuring profiles
